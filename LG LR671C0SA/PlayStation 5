Back to PS5 Settings, change HDR.

You need to find out your TV's maximum luminance output by looking for reviews online, and use the table below to find the accurate value to choose in the PS5's "Adjust HDR" menu.
Use that value for the first two screens, and zero for the third one. If you can still see the sun in the first two panels, you should keep increasing the value until you can't see it anymore.
As soon as you can't see it, you're done

Try the 16th click (1000 nits). If you can't see the sun, you're most likely done.
If you can still see the sun, then try the 25th click (4000 nits). If you can't see the sun, you're most likely done.
If you can still see the sun, you should almost certainly use the maximum value (31st click, 10000 nits).
Mina was 21, with 22 the sun appeared! Same to second setting. Still see it? Tap 1 before it desappears.

The third one is zero.
