On TV search and find for HGiG settings about HDR.
Turn ON Gamer Mode and search and find HGiG for gaming!

Back to PS5 Settings, change HDR.

Congratulations, this is the gold standard, you should absolutely use HGiG.
You need to find out your TV's maximum luminance output by looking for reviews online, and use the table below to find the accurate value to choose in the PS5's "Adjust HDR" menu.
Use that value for the first two screens, and zero for the third one. If you can still see the sun in the first two panels, you should keep increasing the value until you can't see it anymore.
As soon as you can't see it, you're done

First barely visible.
Second barely visible.

If you can still see the sun, then try the 25th click (4000 nits). If you can't see the sun, you're most likely done.
(Mina was 22!) See it? 1 before it desappears.
The third one is zero.
